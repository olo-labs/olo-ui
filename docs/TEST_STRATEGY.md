# Test strategy

Define patterns before contributors invent their own.

## What to test

| Area | Approach | Avoid |
|------|----------|--------|
| **Stores** | Unit tests: actions, selectors, initial state. Mock API layer. | Testing implementation details; testing Zustand internals |
| **Forms** | Component tests: user input, submit, validation messages. Use Testing Library. | Snapshot tests of entire form DOM |
| **Routing** | Tests for path parsing and building: `parsePath()`, `buildPath()`, default routes. | Snapshot tests of router output |
| **API layer** | Unit tests with fetch mock: request URL, method, body; response handling. | No snapshot-heavy or fragile tests |

---

## What not to do

- **No snapshot-heavy tests** — Avoid large DOM or JSON snapshots that break on every UI copy or field reorder.
- **Prefer behavior over implementation** — Test “when user clicks Save, POST is called with payload” rather than “state.x is set”.
- **Mock at boundaries** — Mock `fetch` / API in store tests; mock stores in component tests when needed.

---

## Current coverage

- **`src/routes.test.ts`** — `parsePath()`, `buildPath()`, `buildPathWithTenant()`, default and run-level routing, tenant query param building. **Routing stability:** invalid sub-option fallback, run-level invalid tab fallback, missing runId → list view fallback.
- **`src/store/ui.test.ts`** — UI store navigation updates, properties auto-collapse on section change (tenant selection clearing is done in App; store stays decoupled).
- **`src/App.routing.test.tsx`** — Router integration: disabled section deep link redirects to DEFAULT_PATH; run-level deep link with tenant query syncs store and renders correct view.

Run: `npm run test` (or `npm run test:watch`). Lint: `npm run lint` in olo-ui (enforces no API in components, no store→store imports).

## Tools

- **Vitest** for unit and component tests (see `olo-ui/package.json` scripts: `test`, `test:watch`).
- **React Testing Library** for components: `render`, `screen`, `userEvent`.
- **MSW** (optional) for API mocking in tests.

When adding tests, follow these patterns so the suite stays maintainable.
