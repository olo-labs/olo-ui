# Layout contract

The app layout is fixed. Do not repurpose panels for unrelated concerns. Menu is user-centric: **Build**, **Run**, **Investigate**, **System**.

## Panel ownership model

Each panel has a single intent. If any panel answers two of the questions below, UX becomes confusing.

| Panel | Owns | Does NOT | Answers |
|-------|------|----------|---------|
| **Left** | Tenant selection, primary intent (Build / Run / Investigate / System), sub-view selection | Control execution, render data, show tools | **Where am I working?** |
| **Tools** | Mode-specific actions: action triggers, filters, mode controls, selection helpers | Primary workflow, visualization, detail forms | **What can I do here?** |
| **Main** | Primary cognitive focus; always the dominant surface | Secondary workspace | **What am I looking at?** |
| **Properties** | Selected entity detail only | Second canvas, list, primary workflow | **Details of what I selected.** |

---

## Panel roles

| Panel | Role | Do | Do not |
|-------|------|-----|--------|
| **Left** | Primary navigation (tenant, sections, sub-options) | Section list, tenant dropdown, menu expand/collapse | Secondary workspace, ad-hoc tools |
| **Tools** | Contextual utility (quick actions, filters, search, shortcuts, node inspector, logs preview) | Contextual tools for the current view | Primary workflow, entity detail forms |
| **Main** | Primary workflow (current section/view content) | Section-specific content, lists, run selector, primary actions | Use as a secondary workspace |
| **Properties** | Entity detail (selected item’s properties / form) | Tenant form, run details, node properties | Generic workspace, secondary lists |

---

## Rules

1. **Main always renders primary output.** The main content area is the single source of truth for the current task. Do not move primary workflow into Properties or Tools.
2. **Tools panel = contextual utility.** Tools array per sub-option (`SubOption.toolIds`); tool registry map (`config/toolRegistry.ts`). Tool components talk only to the owning store (receive `storeContext`; no API, no other stores).
3. **Properties panel = entity detail.** One selected entity at a time; form or property list. Do not use it as a second canvas or list.
4. **Left panel = navigation only.** No primary content or forms; only navigation and tenant scope.

Locking this contract early keeps UX consistent as features (tree view, timeline, diff, charts) are added.

## Contextual tools system

- **Tools array per sub-option:** Each `SubOption` in `SECTIONS` can define `toolIds: string[]`. The Tools panel shows only those tools for the active view.
- **Tool registry map:** `config/toolRegistry.ts` — `toolRegistryMap` (id → metadata), optional `toolComponentRegistry` (id → component). `getToolsForView(sectionId, subId, runSelected)` returns the list for the current view.
- **Tool components:** Host registers components via `registerToolComponent(id, component)`. Components receive `{ context: ToolContext }`; `context.storeContext` is the owning-store slice. Tools must not import API or other domain stores.
- **Main = primary output:** Main content always renders the primary workflow; Tools panel is supplementary.

## Flow per mode

| Mode | User intent | Left | Tools | Main | Properties |
|------|-------------|------|-------|------|------------|
| **Build (Canvas)** | Create or modify a pipeline | Build → Canvas | Node palette, shortcuts | Canvas | Selected node properties |
| **Run (Live)** | What is currently happening? | Run → Live Runs | Filters, search | Run list | Selected run summary |
| **Run (run selected)** | Inspect a run | Run → Overview / Tree / Timeline / Debug | Debug controls, breakpoints | Execution tree | Selected node execution state |
| **Investigate** | What happened in the past? | Investigate → Runs | Filters (date, status, cost) | Run list | Selected run summary |
| **Investigate (Diff)** | Compare runs | Investigate → Diff | Run A / Run B selector | Diff canvas | Selected diff node detail |
| **System** | Configure environment | System → Tenant Configuration | (Usually none) | Tenant list | Tenant form |

---

## Golden rule

Each mode must answer clearly:

| Panel | Question |
|-------|----------|
| Left | Where am I? |
| Tools | What can I do here? |
| Main | What am I looking at? |
| Properties | What is selected? |

If any panel answers two of these, UX becomes confusing.
